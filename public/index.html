    Hi,

    Thanks for checking out my project. I had anticipated that some of you
    might be interested in taking a look under the covers to see how this
    was built or what my code looks like. To assist you in your search,
    please take a look at my Github page. It showcases some of my best
    programming work to date.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Just a little introduction about myself.

    My name is Christopher Mason and I have been developing web applications
    and engaging web experiences since 2000. I started out in the early days
    doing PHP and MySQL "Content Management System" development, but have since
    focused my attention to the interactive prowess of Javascript and it's
    flexibility as both a server-side and client-side language.

    I have a passion for designing, developing and seeing an idea come to life.
    If you have an idea that you'd like to see come to life, please feel to
    connect with me on LinkedIn.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As for how this site was built, let me outline briefly the pieces
    that went into creating this little site of mine.

    *   All pages are static. No CMS, no database, easy cloud deployment.

    *   Responsive design and layout was developed with inspiration from
        the Sticko Ghost Theme by DAMIÁN MUTI http://sticko.damianmuti.com/

    *   Initial layout was started from my frontend scaffold, which allows
        quick start of static websites using Grunt, Less, and Livereload.
        https://github.com/crstffr/frontend-scaffold

    *   Layout was converted into Handlebars templates and article content
        was written in Markdown files.

    *   Metalsmith (a Node.js based static site generator) is used to parse
        the Markdown and populate a series of static HTML files using the
        Handlebars templates.

    *   Deployment is done through Brace.io, which links a folder in my
        Dropbox account to an Amazon cloud storage service.  As soon as I
        generate a Metalsmith build, it is almost instantly available on
        the Brace.io staging environment for public testing.

    *   Single click of a button on Brace.io deploys the static site files
        to this public facing production server.

    And that's it. A simple blogging platform with very few requirements
    for the server. I can add or edit pages from anywhere and deploy them
    quickly using just my phone if needed.

    Thanks again for taking a look at my project. If you have any questions,
    please feel free to comment on any of the posts.
