Does the Pope shit in the woods? When he moved down to Venice he had to go door-to-door to tell everyone he's a pederast. Your "revolution" is over, Mr. Lebowski! Condolences! The bums lost! And Hill 364. These young men gave their lives. And Donny too. Donny who... who loved bowling. Every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate.

My point, Dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million. Am I wrong? JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE SAPS! So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh? How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter? Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you. You will receive no bill. He's a good man. And thorough.

1972 Pontiac LeBaron. Yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties. If I can find your money, man— what's in it for the Dude? And I'm talkin' about the Dude here —sometimes there's a man who, wal, he's the man for his time'n place, he fits right in there—and that's the Dude, in Los Angeles. This compulsive fornicator is taking my father for the proverbial ride.

Yes, so we were informed. However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle. I just want to say, sir, that we're both enormous—on a personal level. Keep your ugly fucking goldbricking ass out of my beach community! They won't hurt us, Donny. These men are cowards. Not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin' to find reverse on a Soviet tank.

Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski? This is quite a pad you got here, man. Completely unspoiled. Whose toe was it, Walter? Vee don't care. Vee still vant zat money or vee fuck you up. Sure you'll see some tank battles. But fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle. I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings, smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC and bowling.
