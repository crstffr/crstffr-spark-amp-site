        This is a developer journal that features technical writeups, software theory, amateur circuit designs,
        opinions in programming, brain dumps, sketches, and all sorts of build progress updates on my
        Smart Amp project, which has been a work in progress since December 2012.

        Most of the early content was hand written in notebooks and has been transcribed and formatted for the web.
