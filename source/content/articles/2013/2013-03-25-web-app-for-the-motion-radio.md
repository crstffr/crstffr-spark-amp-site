Sending commands to the `Electric Imp` is as easy as knowing it's POST URL.  Trickier is getting data from the Imp and showing it on the web.  This real-time interface stuff seems like a great place to use [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) or [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/).  I have a VPSCheap account with Meteor already setup and running.  Time to dive back into that.
