A large part of this "whole house" music thing is the software.  ```Spotify``` has entirely revolutionized the way that I listen to and discover new music.  It's a crafty application, built on top of Chromium, meaning apps for it are primarily HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  I believe that moving forward with this experiment I will need to craft my own set of apps for Spotify - to truly customize my listening experience.

One thing I always want is new music - but almost all discovery apps require a hands-on approach.  I'm looking for something that will be constantly finding new music.

Additionally, I'd like to be able to tag songs, albums, artists with different types of classifications.  They could be based upon time, mood, tempo, situation, etc.  Instead of adding songs to individual playlists, I would tag them - the mechanism would be easier - quickly indicating when I thought the song or album was best played.
