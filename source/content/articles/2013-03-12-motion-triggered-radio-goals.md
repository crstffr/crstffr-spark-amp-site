Part of my recent hardware order included a couple [Parallax PIR sensors](http://www.parallax.com/product/555-28027).  These are small motion sensors that are extremely easy to use.  

I want to use these sensors to trigger the power on/off of my radios so that the music can follow me as I move throughout my house.  Additionally, the software can keep track of how long it has been since motion was sensed, then turning off the radio after so many minutes of inactivity.

So, I need to come up with some designs based upon these requirements.  I would like my radios to have the following features...

1. Turn music on when motion is sensed
1. Turn music off after N minutes of no motion
1. Set "active" times so music won't turn on during sleepy times.
1. Have LCD + controls for information display
1. Have LCD + controls for settings and preferences
1. Connect to wifi network.
1. Display current artist/song title on the LCD
1. Buttons to skip tracks
1. Cycle through playlists displayed on the LCD
1. Power on/off speakers using AC relay
1. Power on/off receiver & switch to tuner using IR LEDs
1. Make a case for the prototype
