I want to make use of the Raspberry Pi pin-out headers for some buttons!

The buttons could:

* Next/Prev track in Spotify playlist
* Launch Spotify if it's closed
* Switch between Spotify and Pandora
* Switch playlists/radio stations
* Thumbs up/down for the current song

Also, the `Spot Commander` app needs a couple things to make it better:

* More album art
* Radio station controls
* Thumbs up/down current song
* Skip button moved next to play/pause
* Make the power button harder to hit
